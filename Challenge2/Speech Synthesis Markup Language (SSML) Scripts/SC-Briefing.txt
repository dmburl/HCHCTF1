This briefing contains sensitive information about ongoing threats at Saint Con Hospital.
Multiple systems have been compromised. We have identified suspicious network activity originating from the cardiac monitoring wing between the hours of 11 PM and 7 AM during the night shift.
A high-profile patient in room 311 has been specifically targeted. Their medical records were accessed 47 times in the past week by unauthorized personnel using stolen maintenance credentials.
We have discovered evidence of a rogue wireless "access point" broadcasting as 'HospitalGuest' that is capturing staff login credentials. Do not connect to this network.
Three medical devices show signs of firmware tampering: an insulin pump with serial number IP dash 7744, a cardiac monitor designated CM dash 9912, and a ventilator marked VT dash 3301.
