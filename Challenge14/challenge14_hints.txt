# Challenge 14: DICOM Manipulation - Hints

## Hint 1 (Easy - 10 points penalty)
"DICOM files can contain private tags that aren't displayed by standard viewers. Try using command-line tools to see ALL metadata."

## Hint 2 (Medium - 20 points penalty)
"Look for tags in the 0x0009 and 0x0011 ranges. Also check the ImageComments field - it's often overlooked."

## Hint 3 (Hard - 30 points penalty)
"Use dcmdump or pydicom to examine every single tag. The attacker only modified standard patient identification fields."

## Solution Commands:

### Using dcmdump (DCMTK):
```bash
dcmdump hospital_xray_20241015.dcm | grep -i "comment\|private\|original"
```

### Using pydicom (Python):
```python
import pydicom
ds = pydicom.dcmread('hospital_xray_20241015.dcm')
print(ds.ImageComments)
print(ds[0x0009, 0x1001].value)  # Original patient name
print(ds[0x0009, 0x1002].value)  # Original patient ID
```

### Using exiftool:
```bash
exiftool -a -G1 hospital_xray_20241015.dcm | grep -i comment
```

## Flag Format:
FLAG{VIP_PATIENT_ELIZABETH_HARTWELL_311_COMPROMISED}

## Story Connection:
- Elizabeth Hartwell is the VIP patient from Room 311 (Challenge 2 IVR, Challenge 3 Wristband)
- This proves her cardiac imaging data was specifically targeted
- The attacker tried to hide the evidence by spoofing the patient name
