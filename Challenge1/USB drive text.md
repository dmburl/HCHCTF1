URGENT - SAINTCON HOSPITAL SECURITY BREACH

To whoever finds this drive,

I'm a systems administrator at SaintCon Hospital and I can't stay silent anymore. Something terrible is happening here, but I can't report it through normal channels - I think someone on the inside is involved.

WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED:
- Patient data is being accessed inappropriately
- Medical devices in the cardiac wing are showing abnormal network traffic
- VIP patient records are being targeted specifically
- Someone has been using maintenance credentials after hours

I've been documenting everything, but it's not safe to keep records here.
I've set up a secure way to share more information.

Call this number for additional details: (702) 846-3729 

When prompted, use access code: STCON (78266)

The caller will ask you three verification questions to ensure you're legitimate. Study these details:

1. The compromised wing primarily treats: CARDIAC patients
2. The suspicious activity peaks during: NIGHT SHIFT (11 PM - 7 AM)  
3. The targeted VIP patient was last seen in room: 311

Time is running out. They're planning something bigger.
Check room 311 - there might be physical evidence there.

A concerned friend,
-J.M.

P.S. If you're reading this, I've probably already disappeared. Trust no one in hospital administration.
